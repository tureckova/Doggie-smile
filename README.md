Computer Vision for Faces - Final project

This project involves the application for automatic photography of the dogs. It detects dogs in the video stream and atracts their attention. The quality of the image is automatically evaluated and accepted only if all the dogs in the picture are looking on camera.

The program is writen in c++ and uses openCV 3.3.0 and dLib v19.4 libraries.

To run the program download all models and sounds and put them into the same folder as the cpp file.

All the model files are available for download here: https://owncloud.cesnet.cz/index.php/s/V0KIPJoUFllpAXh

The video on my YouTube channel: https://youtu.be/g2TpWr6me1w demonstrates the functionality of the program.
